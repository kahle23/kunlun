     * Normally, it is silent (not throw exception) and executes synchronously.
     * Controlling the execution of different modes through parameters is an expected implementation.
     *
     * In the parameter list, the "platform" is not necessary, because "platform" can be passed through "properties".
     * It can also be passed directly through the implementation class.
     *
     * The event category is not necessary, because it can be associated with the event code.
     *
     * The category of event code:
     *      record:*        the record type event
     *      error:*         the error type event
     *      access:*        the access type event
     *      statistic:*     the statistic type event
     *      full-track:*    the full track data type event (traceless tracking)
     *
     * @param code The event code (event identifier), indicating a certain type of event
     *             (such as user login events, can be null, get from properties)
     * @param time The time at which the event occurred
     *             (can be null, get from properties)
     * @param principal The principal information, such as the user's unique id or user object, and so on
     *                    (can be null, get from properties)
     * @param properties The other event properties (string or map or java bean)
