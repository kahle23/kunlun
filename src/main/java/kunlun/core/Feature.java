/**
 * The feature. What is feature?
 *
 * For example
 * The car must have an engine, which can be fuel or electric, or even hybrid.
 * The transmission can be automatic or manual, but it cannot be both automatic and manual.
 * The execution of the software should be similar to put the tick in the configuration menu when buying a car (also analogous to ordering at a restaurant), and then producing an output.
